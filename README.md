Upon reviewing, I found it most efficient to write my own new file ("ashir.html"). I've used code from the previous file as well but to make it a bit more responsive, I had to take some steps on my own.

## I updated:

main.css: I've appended my styles at the end so It doesn't mix up with ones pre-defined in the file.
ashir.html (new): This is my version of index.html. I'm still in progress with the commenting...

## misc:
1. For CSS, I've mainly used [Tailwindcss (CDN)](https://tailwindcss.com/).

THAT'S IT FOR NOW!!!
