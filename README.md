Marketing firm site that I updated
## I updated:

main.css: I've appended my styles at the end so It doesn't mix up with ones pre-defined in the file.<br/>
ashir.html (new): This is my version of index.html. I'm still in progress with the commenting...

## misc:
1. For CSS, I've mainly used [Tailwindcss (CDN)](https://tailwindcss.com/).

THAT'S IT FOR NOW!!!
